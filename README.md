First time using GIT tryout
Hey Guys!
So here I am trying to get to know GIT before I ever know how much I will need it during studying.
But still quite excited it looks overviewable (overzichtelijk in Dutch).
I will do groceries and watch a movie tonight, as we're not allowed outside after 21:00.
Cheers!
